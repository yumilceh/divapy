### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository contains a Python version of the vocal tract contained in the [Diva Model](http://sites.bu.edu/guentherlab/software/diva-source-code/) originally implemented in Matlab and described in [1]. Divapy allows an efficient integration to python packages.
* Version 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* It is recommended to add the package to your Python path.
* Dependencies: [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [numpy_groupies](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy_groupies), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [pyaudio](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyAudio), [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_install.html).
* Examples of use are available for [Python executables](https://github.com/yumilceh/divapy/tree/master/Executables) and for [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/yumilceh/divapy/tree/master/Notebooks).

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Juan M. Acevedo-Valle (juan.manuel.acevedo.valle@upc.edu)
